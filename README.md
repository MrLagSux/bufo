# Bufo
## Overview
Bufo is a programming language that I created for my own personal exploration and experimentation.  
It features a whacky syntax, with a focus on imperative and functional programming that encourages creativity and experimentation.

It is not intended to be fast or special (this may be subject to change).

This project is Part 2 of my journey, the first being [HauptLang](https://github.com/MrLagSux/HauptLang).

**All features are highly experimental and might change at any time.**
